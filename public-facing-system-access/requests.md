Other details about how you will be this resource

While the Hibernate project is open-source and owned by the Commonhaus Foundation (a Florida non-profit, see https://www.commonhaus.org/), most core contributors are IBM employees. I am, too, and can be reached at yrodiere@ibm.com.

As we were recently moved from Red Hat to IBM, many projects we and our coworkers work on are preparing for integration in (or as) IBM products.

In anticipation of this integration, and ahead of product work, we would like to start work *upstream*, in the open-source community -- as we always do.
The most obvious item on the agenda would be a better integration of Hibernate with "DB2 for Z". This requires access to an instance of DB2 for Z, which we do not have in our community infrastructure at the moment.

Note we do already have access to LinuxOne and regularly test our software on Linux + s390x. Our request is for a separate s390x instance *running z/OS* and preferably *with Semeru runtimes and DB2 pre-installed* (otherwise I'll try to figure out how to install them).

We would use this instance to run integration tests as part of our CI process. The goal would be to check that SQL generated by Hibernate ORM works as expected on DB2 for Z.
We would need the instance available either 24/7, or on specific schedule every day for a few hours.

Which operating system are you interested in doing development for?

Describe any previous open source contributions

I am a core member of the Hibernate team, along with ~10 teammates also working at IBM.
We contribute daily to open-source projects, mainly Hibernate ones, but also Quarkus.
See:

* All top 8 contributors to Hibernate ORM: https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-orm/graphs/contributors
* The #10 and #11 contributors to Quarkus: https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/graphs/contributors

The Hibernate project is a JPA implementation that powers persistence into relational databases in various popular Java platforms, from Spring to Quarkus to WildFly. It is the most popular JPA implementation and a very popular way to persist data in Java.

Hibernate is mostly relevant to IBM as:

1. A key component of existing Red Hat products: Red Hat build of Quarkus, Red Hat Enterprise Application Platform, Red Hat build of Keycloak.
2. A key component of the upcoming Quarkus offering at IBM.
3. A potential key component of future versions of Websphere/Liberty (still being discussed).

Other details about how you will be this resource
We are developing and maintaining Deskflow (n√©e Synergy community edition), an open source C++ mouse and keyboard sharing tool, and want to extend support for IBM Z environments (z/OS and LinuxONE). Access to this development resource program will be used to build and test on big-endian systems. Developers use Deskflow to share a mouse and keyboard between IBM Z consoles and Linux dev systems. As well as improving productivity for IBM Z developers, as a famous repo ~20k stars, the fixes and documentation we contribute back to the community can be used as good examples for others who port and run open source tools on IBM Z. Users from our community requested that we add IBM Z to our CI.

Other details about how you will be this resource

PowerZX is an extension on z/OS that aims to provide open source packages for usage on x390x.
The idea is that we rebuild several packages in line with current PowerEL baseline versions and patches, as such we want to build an experience for developers and users to have similar experience with just the need to recompile and run.
While we do know that this is not going to be always possible, we do expect to have few changes/differnces between the baselines.
*** Please note that tihs is a new project that we are starting in line with other projects we will be building on, like PowerEL, currently there are no resources publicly available due to having limited testing capability ***
We do have PowerEL for IBM Power ppc64le and ppc64 (www.powerel.org), and will be staring an effort for IBM AIX and IBM i (still to be made public soon), with the same initial idea and logic, as wer do also have PowerEL for IBM Mainframe s390x, we think having this for z/OS would be relevant.
