Other details about how you will be this resource
We are developing and maintaining Deskflow (n√©e Synergy community edition), an open source C++ mouse and keyboard sharing tool, and want to extend support for IBM Z environments (z/OS and LinuxONE). Access to this development resource program will be used to build and test on big-endian systems. Developers use Deskflow to share a mouse and keyboard between IBM Z consoles and Linux dev systems. As well as improving productivity for IBM Z developers, as a famous repo ~20k stars, the fixes and documentation we contribute back to the community can be used as good examples for others who port and run open source tools on IBM Z. Users from our community requested that we add IBM Z to our CI.

Other details about how you will be this resource

PowerZX is an extension on z/OS that aims to provide open source packages for usage on x390x.
The idea is that we rebuild several packages in line with current PowerEL baseline versions and patches, as such we want to build an experience for developers and users to have similar experience with just the need to recompile and run.
While we do know that this is not going to be always possible, we do expect to have few changes/differnces between the baselines.
*** Please note that tihs is a new project that we are starting in line with other projects we will be building on, like PowerEL, currently there are no resources publicly available due to having limited testing capability ***
We do have PowerEL for IBM Power ppc64le and ppc64 (www.powerel.org), and will be staring an effort for IBM AIX and IBM i (still to be made public soon), with the same initial idea and logic, as wer do also have PowerEL for IBM Mainframe s390x, we think having this for z/OS would be relevant.
