# Upcoming digest:
As we wrap up the year, here’s a quick snapshot of what’s new and improved in the zopen community. A huge thank you to everyone who contributed, tested, and provided feedback!

## 🛠 New Tools Now Available

* **nnn** – Terminal file manager (Thanks to **Sachin T.**)
* **htop** – *Beta* support, now usable for monitoring tasks on z/OS.
* **clangd** – Language server support (Thanks to **Mike Grossman**)
* **clang-tidy** – Modern static analysis for C/C++ (Thanks to **Mike Grossman**)
    * *Learn more in Mike’s article:* [Building a Modern Vim Configuration – IDE Intelligence with LSP](https://blog.neunetz.it/building-a-modern-vim-configuration-from-scratch-part-3-ide-intelligence-with-lsp/)
* **micro** – Modern, easy-to-use terminal text editor.
* **liboqs** – Post-quantum cryptography library (Thank you to **Haritha D**)

## ⚙️ z/OS-Critical Tooling Improvements

We invested heavily in improving support for **preserving extended attributes and file tags**, which are critical on z/OS.

### Enhanced Tools
* `coreutils` (`mv`, `cp` preserve extended attributes with the `-p` option)
* `tar` - now preserves file tags and extended attributes
* `rpm` - now preserves file tags and extended attributes
* `rsync` - now preserves file tags when syncing from z/OS to z/OS

### 🌐 Curl Auto-Tagging
We added auto-tagging capabilities to **curl**:
1.  **Auto-Tag:** When you download, it will automatically tag the file based on the file content
2.  **Environment:** It continues to honour `_ENCODE_FILE_NEW`.
3.  **Override:** You can override the tag manually using the new flag: `--tag <ccsid>`.

# Retrospective

Review 2025 goals from earlier in the year: https://github.com/orgs/zopencommunity/discussions/934

## What went well
* Major impacts from University contributions -> rpm, redis, grpc, llamacpp, and more
* Reached 300+ projects
* Team leveraged AI to port more efficiently
* z/OS public facing program enabled more contributions - Vignesh, Mike Grossman, Karl Williamson, and others.
* Package manager has become more stable

## What to improve
* Upstreaming priority was reduced relative to other items
* Quality was not always a priority - it's unclear which projects are in alpha/beta/stable state
* Issues continue to queue up
* Need a better system for prioritizing zopen items - consider https://github.com/orgs/zopencommunity/projects/5
* More and more potential users are asking for an offline installer
* 2025 goals we did not accomplish:
  * Enhanced Testing: More unit and end-to-end tests
  * zopen: Consistent Error Handling: Standardize and improve error messages.
  * Additional tutorials, how-to guides, reference. See https://diataxis.fr/ (thanks @ijmitch )
  * Work towards OpenSSF Best Practices Badge.


## Action items
* Introduce a state indicator (manual or AI?)
  * Experimental / Alpha – builds, may work, APIs unstable
  * Beta – functional, known gaps, limited support
  * Stable – production-ready, supported, documented
* Continue to leverage AI in all facets - use augment? 
* Fix the metaport builds :D
* Document and publicize the new installer
* 2025 goals we did not accomplish:
  * Enhanced Testing: More unit and end-to-end tests
  * zopen: Consistent Error Handling: Standardize and improve error messages.
  * Additional tutorials, how-to guides, reference. See https://diataxis.fr/ (thanks @ijmitch )
  * Work towards OpenSSF Best Practices Badge.


**Thanks again to all contributors and community members. Looking forward to building even more together in the year ahead!**

# New zopen package manager
* Dev release now created:
  * https://github.com/zopencommunity/metaport/releases (zopen install meta --release-line dev)
* Next Steps:
  * [ ] Generate offline installer documentation
  * [ ] Update all zopen community documentation
  * [ ] Update testing
  * [ ] Migrate zopen community build to new package manager
  * [ ] Consider rpm as an additional supported format? - Set up discussion with Russell


New tool updates:
* s5cmd - now installs the binary (still need to fix the version)
* htop alpha - now available!
* clangd
* clang-tidy
* micro editor
* library - liboqs for quantum safe encryption
* openmp library
* nnn - file manager viewer

New updates - preserving extended attributes and file tags for:
* coreutils (mv, cp)  (with -p option)
* tar
* rpm
* rsync

What's next?
* Tools? https://github.com/orgs/zopencommunity/discussions/1019
* rclone?


## Other Updates:
* zoslib: enhancing untagged file detection support
* act - github actions
* Vim dataset I/O - next steps
