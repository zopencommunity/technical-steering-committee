# Retrospective

## What went well
* Major impacts from University contributions -> rpm, redis, grpc, llamacpp, and more
* Reached 300+ projects
* Team leveraged AI to port more efficiently
* z/OS public facing program enabled more contributions - Vignesh, Mike Grossman, Karl Williamson, and others.
* Package manager has become more stable

## What to improve
* Upstreaming priority was reduced relative to other items
* Quality was not always a priority - it's unclear which projects are in alpha/beta/stable state
* Issues continue to queue up
