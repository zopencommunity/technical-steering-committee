* Updates (tooling/blogs/etc)

## Recurring Todos:
  * [ ] Review of Public Facing program requests: https://github.com/zopencommunity/technical-steering-committee/blob/main/public-facing-system-access/requests.md

**2026 Roadmap:**

## 1. Community-Driven Priorities

- Expand **community support & collaboration**, including:
  - Mentorship and “first contribution” pathways
  - Outreach to Discord communities (e.g., System Z Enthusiasts)
  - Clear guidance for new contributors, including sandbox or test environments

---

## 2. AI-First Enablement (Where It Adds Value)
**Objective:** Reduce toil, accelerate porting, and improve code quality.

- Standardize AI usage for **porting workflows** (e.g., bob, Copilot, Gemini)
- Use AI to track **upstream releases and deltas**
- Augment **code reviews** with AI (clearly define advisory vs trusted)
- Automate **issue triage** (categorization, labeling, prioritization)
- Emphasize AI-assisted workflows for MCP servers, porting, and other repetitive tasks

---

## 3. Package Manager & Installer
**Objective:** Make installation reliable, predictable, and enterprise-ready.

- Stabilize the **new package manager**
- Fix **dependency resolution issues**
- Fully document and publicize the **new installer**
- Design and prototype an **offline installer** (high user demand)
- Evaluate **RPM format** as an optional packaging format
- Provide guidance for **shared vs user-specific installs**

---

## 4. Documentation, Onboarding & Developer Enablement
**Objective:** Reduce friction for new users and contributors.

- Expand **“First Contribution” guides**, tutorials, and onboarding paths
- Standardize `README.md` content:
  - Upstream source
  - License
  - z/OS-specific notes
  - Declared maturity level
- Provide guidance for accessing **compilers, shells, and z/OS environments**
- Improve developer tooling for **build, debug, trace, and packaging workflows**

---

## 5. Quality, Stability & Lifecycle Transparency
**Objective:** Make project maturity explicit and measurable.

- Introduce a **project maturity indicator**:
  - *Experimental / Alpha* – unstable, APIs may change
  - *Beta* – functional with known gaps
  - *Stable* – production-ready, documented
- Require projects to declare their maturity
- Prioritize **performance improvements** for existing ports
- Clearly communicate **production readiness** to users

---

## 6. Testing & CI Foundations
**Objective:** Catch issues earlier and improve confidence in releases.

- Expand **unit and end-to-end testing** across critical projects
- Define a **baseline test framework** for zopen projects
- Prioritize coverage for:
  - Package manager
  - Core libraries
  - High-usage ports
- Integrate **CI/automation** to support reliable releases

---

## 7. z/OS-Native Integration
**Objective:** Move from “it builds” to “it fits z/OS.”

- Improve integration with:
  - Dataset I/O
  - RACF
- Address common pain points: (e.g)
  - UTF-8 vs EBCDIC handling
  - Terminal compatibility (xterm vs xterm-256color)
- Strengthen build-system support for z/OS languages:
  - Make, CMake, Ninja
  - COBOL, PL/I, HLASM workflows

---

## 8. Strategic Ports & Performance Focus
**Objective:** Prioritize fewer, higher-impact ports with clear use cases.

**Candidate focus areas:**
- Accelerated OpenSSL
- LuaJIT
- rclone
- and more..

- Increase focus on **hardware exploitation** (OpenSSL, GPG)
- Tie new ports to **explicit target users and use cases**
- Improve **performance and reliability** of existing ports

---

## 9. Upstreaming & Open Source Citizenship
**Objective:** Reduce long-term maintenance costs.

- Make **upstreaming a first-class goal**
- Track upstream status per project:
  - Not upstreamed
  - Partially upstreamed
  - Fully upstreamed
- Identify and document **upstream blockers early**

---

## 10. Security & Trustworthiness
**Objective:** Increase confidence for enterprise adoption.

- Work toward the **OpenSSF Best Practices Badge**
- Enable **automated source code scanning**
- Formalize **security disclosure and bulletin processes**
- Improve visibility of **security posture per project**

---

## 11. Additional Focus Areas
**Governance & Focus**
- Define **“core” vs “community” projects**, with different expectations for testing, stability, and support

**Access & Environment Support**
- Explore sandbox or test environments for **compiler access**
- Support both **learning/experimentation and production use cases**

**Community & Collaboration**
- Improve channels for mentorship and contributor engagement
- Increase collaboration with external communities (Discord, forums)



# Updates:

* **Clang update to OEL v3. Some warnings now elevated to errors**
  * Migration effort underway
  * https://github.com/zopencommunity/meta/issues/337
  * Introduced a requirement on PTF UO06021
  * Rebuilding all packages
 
* **DuckDB** Blog
* **Idea:** Create a DuckDB blog post showcasing its use on IBM Z / s390x mainframes, similar to previous LoongArch post.
* **Requirements / Next Steps:**
* Decide timeline (Feb for small test, Mar for larger test).
* Coordinate with Dmitry, Igor, and Lyz for platform support and Open Mainframe Project background.
* Arrange access to real hardware with enough disk space (200–500 GB suggested).
* Run benchmarks (consider Python support and package limitations on zOS/Linux on Z).
* Contribute build info and testing results for the blog.

* **Improving dataset I/O support across the board**
  * Sachin is working on a library to enable dataset I/O support for all tools
    * This could be extended to improve auto-conversion support (using iconv instead of LE auto-conversion facilities)

* **OpenSSL**
  * Post-Quantum Support - liboqs provider (almost done)
  * Enabling hardware crypto acceleration (in progress)
  * RACF certificate support (not started)
 
* **DNF5/RPM registry**
  * Considering pulp project (back-end for Red Hat Satellite) - https://pulpproject.org/
  * Considering self-hosting

# AI Integration Updates
* CoPilot access coming soon:
  * <img width="509" height="225" alt="Screenshot 2026-01-22 at 8 32 26 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1f0e3b7-4f7a-4ef2-b884-c35f73a5d8b2" />
* Next steps for Augment
* Shell - Gemini integration for fixing currency issues
  * Start with AI-assisted patch conflict resolution

# Triage
* Triage of meta issues underway: https://github.com/zopencommunity/meta
  * We have 600 open issues altogether in the zopen community: https://github.com/search?q=org%3Azopencommunity++is%3Aissue+state%3Aopen+&type=issues
  * Half are 2 years or older: https://github.com/search?q=org%3Azopencommunity++is%3Aissue+state%3Aopen+created%3A%3C2024-01-01+&type=issues
