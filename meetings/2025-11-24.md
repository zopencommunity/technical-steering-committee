## AI Workflows
* Automating Servicing of Client Issues on GitHub
  - **Client issues are created as GitHub issues**
  - **Classify and tag the issue automatically**
     - Component detection  
     - Priority / severity estimation  
  - **Trigger a build** for the project associated with the issue
  - **Analyze the relevant source code** to identify suspect components or regression points
  - **Automatically generate a test case** that reproduces the issue (where possible)
  - **Attach an automated summary** to the GitHub issue:
     - Build results  
     - Analysis findings  
     - Test case generation status  
  - **Attempt an automated fix** using AI-assisted patching
  - **Push a branch + PR** containing:
     - Proposed fix  
     - Generated test case  
     - Summary of changes  
  - **Comment on the GitHub issue** with:
     - Link to the PR  
     - Summary of attempted fix  
     - Any areas requiring manual review
