# 2026 Action Items

## 1. User Feedback & Community Direction
**Goal:** Ensure priorities reflect real user needs.

- Launch a **2026 community survey** to guide roadmap decisions - https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScpKj5G-PqzwaoG8uiP7x84dZgvPwNHYddaF_REY66Aimz-OQ/viewform
- Launch a **separate survey for new tools to port**. (related: https://github.com/orgs/zopencommunity/discussions/1019)
- Share survey results publicly and tie them directly to roadmap themes.

---

## 2. AI-First Enablement
**Goal:** Systematically apply AI where it measurably improves outcomes.

- **Porting:** Evaluate and standardize on AI tooling (bob, Copilot, Gemini).
- **Release currency:** Use AI to track upstream releases and deltas.
- **Review:** Augment code reviews with AI (Copilot / Augment).
- **Issue triage:** Use AI to categorize, prioritize, and label issues.
- Document where AI is **trusted vs advisory** to maintain quality.

---

## 3. Package Manager & Installation Experience
**Goal:** Make installation reliable, and enterprise-friendly.

- Stabilize the **new package manager**.
- Fix **metaport build issues**.
- Fully document and publicize the **new installer**.
- Design and prototype an **offline installer** (high user demand).
- Consider rpm format 

---

## 4. Quality, Stability & Lifecycle Clarity
**Goal:** Make project maturity explicit and quality measurable.

- Introduce a **project state indicator**:
  - **Experimental / Alpha** – unstable, APIs may change
  - **Beta** – functional with known gaps
  - **Stable** – production-ready, documented, supported
- Require each project to declare its state.
- Enhance `README.md` files with:
  - Upstream source location
  - License information
  - z/OS-specific notes
  - Current maturity state

---

## 5. Testing & CI Improvements
**Goal:** Catch issues earlier and improve confidence.

- Expand **unit and end-to-end testing** across critical ports.
- Identify a **baseline test framework** for zopen projects.
- Prioritize tests for:
  - Package manager
  - Core libraries
  - High-usage ports

---

## 6. z/OS-Native Integration
**Goal:** Go beyond “it builds” toward “it fits z/OS.”

- Improve integration across the board with:
  - Dataset I/O
  - RACF
- Strengthen build-system support for z/OS languages (COBOL, PL/I, HLASM):
  - Make
  - CMake
  - Ninja

---

## 7. Strategic Ports & Performance
**Goal:** Focus on fewer, higher-impact ports.

**High-priority candidates:**
- LLDB
- Accelerated OpenSSL
- LuaJIT
- rclone
- Log analysis tooling (e.g., gonzo)

- Increase focus on **hardware exploitation** (OpenSSL, GPG).
- Tie new ports to **clear use cases** and target users.

---

## 8. Upstreaming & Open Source Citizenship
**Goal:** Reduce long-term maintenance burden.

- Re-establish **upstreaming as a first-class priority**.
- Track upstream status explicitly:
  - Not upstreamed
  - Partially upstreamed
  - Fully upstreamed
- Document upstream blockers early.

---

## 9. Security & Trust
**Goal:** Increase confidence for enterprise adoption.

- Work toward the **OpenSSF Best Practices Badge**.
- Enable **automated source code scanning**.
- Revisit and formalize **security bulletins and disclosure process**.
- Improve visibility of security posture per project.

---

## Additional Ideas to Consider

### Governance & Focus
- Define **“core” vs “community” projects** with different expectations.

### Onboarding & Enablement
- Create a **“First Contribution” path** for students and new contributors.
- Add a **maintainer playbook** (release process, expectations, tooling).
