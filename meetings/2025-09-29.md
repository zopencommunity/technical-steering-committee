## Other updates

* Automating the Porting process:
  1. Start with `zopen generate` - accept inputs via command-line args - https://github.com/zopencommunity/meta/pull/1107 (in progress)
  1.1 Add conditional logic based on language (Go, Java, Python, C/C++ should all have different defaults)
  2. Establish an mcp server for zopen - https://github.com/zopencommunity/zopen-mcp-server  (in progress)
  3. Leverage MCP servers for https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server, zopen to create a starter project  (in progress)
  4. Extend the zopen mcp server for zopen-build 
  5. Leverage existing patches (using RAG) + LLM knowledge to diagnose/assist porting
